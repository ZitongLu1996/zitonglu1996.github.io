**I am a second-year PhD student in cognitive neuroscience working with [Dr. Julie Golomb](https://psychology.osu.edu/people/golomb.9) in [Vision and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://u.osu.edu/golomblab/) at The Ohio State University**. 
Also, I am the **OSU EEGlab manager**ÔºÅ

Before that, received B.Eng. in software engineering from Northeastern University in China in 2018 and M.S. in cognitive neuroscience from East China Normal University in 2021. 
I worked with [Dr. Yixuan Ku](https://psy.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/851) in **[Memory and Emotion Lab](https://sysumelab.com/) and did some studies about visual working memory and face perception. 
I am the author of [NeuroRA](https://zitonglu1996.github.io/NeuroRA/), a python toolbox for multi-modal neural data representational analysis, and [a Chinese Python handbook for EEG data analysis](https://github.com/ZitongLu1996/Python-EEG-Handbook).

I am interested in **understanding how we process object information in the complex and dynamics world using behavioral, EEG, fMRI and computational approaches**. 
My main research aims are to:  
(1) Explore the behavioral and neural mechanisms of spatial representations and object-location binding across eye movements.  
(2) Unfold the spatiotemporal neural mechanisms of depth and 3D perception.  
(3) Decode the object and face information from brain activity to better understand our visual systems.
