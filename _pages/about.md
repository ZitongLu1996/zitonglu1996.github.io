I am Zitong Lu (路子童 in Chinese), a second-year PhD student in cognitive neuroscience working with [Dr. Julie Golomb](https://psychology.osu.edu/people/golomb.9) in [Vision and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://u.osu.edu/golomblab/) at The Ohio State University. 
Also, I am the OSU EEGlab manager！

Before that, I received B.Eng. in software engineering from Northeastern University in China in 2018 and M.S. in cognitive neuroscience from East China Normal University in 2021. 
I worked with [Dr. Yixuan Ku](https://psy.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/851) in [Memory and Emotion Lab](https://sysumelab.com/) and did some studies about visual working memory and face perception. 
I am the author of [NeuroRA](https://zitonglu1996.github.io/NeuroRA/), a python toolbox for multi-modal neural data representational analysis, and [a Chinese Python handbook for EEG data analysis](https://github.com/ZitongLu1996/Python-EEG-Handbook).

I am interested in **understanding how we process object information in the complex and dynamics world using behavioral, EEG, fMRI and computational approaches**.  
My main research interets are:  
(1) Visual stability and object-location binding - How to trigger spatiotopic representations and spatiotopic object-location binding in behavior? How do our brains integrate object locations from retinotopic coordinates to spatiotopic coordinates? What's the neural mechanism of object-location binding?  
(2) Depth & 3D perception - How our brains represent depth information of the object in a image? & How do our brain process depth information of the object in the real world and 3D integration in space (using fMRI) and time (using EEG)?  
(3) Brain encoding and decoding models - Using Deep Learning methods to construct the encoder from visual inputs to neural signals, the decoder from neural signals to visual inputs, and inter-individual neural converters.
