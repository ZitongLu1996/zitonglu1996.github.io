Living in a complex and dynamic world, we perceive a lot of information all the time and integrate them to form our own perception, memory and understanding of the world. 
Even though the input information is 2D and changes in the retina, we still have the ability to steadily perceive the world, understand the world and achieve our goals. 
My research is to combine human psychophysics, eye-tracking, neuroimaging (fMRI & EEG), computational methods (linear-regression, MVPA, RSA, IEM and pRF) and deep learning models (CNN, GAN and VAE) 
to better understand both behavioral and neural mechanisms of visual processing. 
Below are the topics and projects I am interested in and working on: 

### Object-location binding  
> Dynamic saccade context  
- Dynamic saccade context triggers more stable object-location binding  
<!--
- A gating mechanism of spatiotopic object-location binding  
-->
> Landmarks  
- The influence of task-irrelevant landmark on spatiotopic localizer and object-location binding     
<!--
- The influence of task-relevant landmark on object-location binding  
-->
> Object movements  
- The influence of a moving object’s location on object identity judgements    
<!--
- The influence of movement predictability influence object-trajectory binding of a moving object  
-->

### Depth and 3D perception  
> Temporally dynamic brain representations of relative and absolute depth of the object in an image  

> Temporal perception of image properties in human brains  

> Unfolding the spatiotemporal neural mechanisms of 3D perception in the human brain: an fMRI-EEG fusion study  

; Reconstruction “Small in the distance and big on the contrary” from human brain activity  
; An fMRI and EEG dataset of 3D perception task  
; How 3D location influence object identity judgement?  
-->

### Generally spatial representations  
> Retinotopic and spatiotopic representations in human brains: a fMRI study
<!--
> Simulate spatial encoding across eye movements using RNN or SNN**
-->

### Deep neural networks in cognitive neuroscience  
> Facial representation comparisons between human brain and hierarchical deep convolutional neural network reveal a fatigue repetition suppression mechanism  

> Image & brain activity bidirectional reconstruction  
- Decode what we see: Component by component image reconstruction from human fMRI  
<!--
- Prediction of brain activity from what you see using self-supervised learning  
> Face Wheels: construct customized continuous face spaces  
-->

### Attention and working memory  
> Dynamic object-based encoding and automatically prioritized position encoding in visual working memory  
> Temporal dynamics of neural signature underlying category-tuned attentional filter disruption
